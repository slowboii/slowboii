### Hi there 👋
So this is a quick introduction of myself, and i'm aware that I still have a long way in front of me, before I can shamelessly say that i'm a skilled developer, hehe, happy reading..

Subjects this semester:
   - React full-stack
   - Python
   - Laravel (A php framework)


For those in need; 
I'm a freelancer taking commisions for websites and ideas as well, and you can contact me if you want to know more about that!
