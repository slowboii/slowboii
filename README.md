### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

The classes i'm taking, and will be studying until I feel i can move on is
  
  - Azure
  - Digital Security
  - Managing and running windows server

I have good knowledge of PHP programming, and will also jump into python for sure!
I'm only doing 3 courses right now because I don't wawnt to take too many at the same time and feel overwhelmed, which I wholeheartedly believe was a good decision! 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a hobby project where I need  to dive into node.js, and react.js, and my goal is to make a working, and pretty full-stack web-app!
