### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a norwegian IT student this year. 

Classes i'm enrolled into this semester;
  
  - Azure
  - Digital Security
  - Managing and running windows servers

I'm only doing 3 courses right now because I don't wawnt to take too many at the same time and feel overwhelmed, which I wholeheartedly believe was a good decision! 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a hobby project where I need  to learn node.js, and react.js, and my goal is to make a beautiful looking, and working, and pretty full-stack web-app.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning node.js, next.js, react.js
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: My facebook is linked, send me a DM there if you must.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about whatever you want, except for anything that requires 3 brain cells to figure out :)

- 
I have good knowledge of PHP programming from before I started studying, because I used to write PHP code towards a text-based mafia game called "Scandicmafia", witch is run by someone else today.

Scandicmafia.org is online if you want to check the project out. It has been online since 2008/2009, and had at it's peak around 15,000 unique users, witch back then was a impressive achievement. My role was a assisstant to the original owner, but i've written a fair bit of code witch is in use, even today.
